# PyBer_Matplotlib_Python - Module 5 - Challenge

## Overview of Project

The PyBer Analysis uses Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib to combine dataframes, perform calculations and analyses, and visualize the results with an all-encompassing line graph. 

### Purpose

Pyber is a ride sharing app with customers and services in Urban, Suburban, and Rural cities. It is our job to combine all this data and summarize it for the company's decision makers. This line graph will show cumulative fares by city type for Jan-Apr 2019.

### Results

The data was captured in two different files, total drivers by city, and individual rides. These files needed to be merged into one dataframe and processed by the groupby function in order to be summarized by city type. Once the data was merged metrics such as total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride, and average fare per driver were summarized by city type.

*There is a statement summarizing 3 business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types. (4pts)
Clearly Pyber has distinctive revenue groupings based on city type. Pyber collects most of their revenue in Urban cities, next Suburban cities, and least revenue in rural cities. It is not clear from this chart if more revenue could be generated by increasing drivers in suburban or rural cities.
